# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

This is my attempt at the Cloud Resume Challenge. It is a multiple-step resume project created by Forrest Brazeal which helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career in Cloud. I attempted this challenge using AWS as my preferred platform and Terraform as my preferrred IaC (Infrastructure as Code) software.
